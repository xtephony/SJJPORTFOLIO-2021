# SJJPORTFOLIO-2021

I am a full stack student with nucamp and trying to put my best foot forward.  This is my second bootstrap portfolio.  The first I created was for a friend's daughter who is a professional dancer.  You can find that here under "Kennedy Phelps".  While working on this second portfolio (first for myself), I am putting more focus on scss.  I had problems with the navigation on one page on Kennedy's portfolio and have yet to figure out how to fix it. 

Please send me any comments and suggestions on how this can be improved. My contact email is sjohns34@hotmail.com.  

Thanks for reading.
Stephanie
